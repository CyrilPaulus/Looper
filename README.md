# Looper

Looper is software implementation of a guitar looping pedal. I searched the web for such software but never found something that seems easy to use. I have no experience with programming real time audio software so it's probably totally wrong. But it fit my needs and should be considered as an experiment.

## Getting Started

Looper is made of two component 
* A host program written in python, that simulate the looping software.
* An arduino program that just relay 5 buttons to the host software

### Prerequisites

* **Arduino IDE** or something compatible for the arduino code
* **Python 3.6** with the following libraries
    * **curses** to have a simple CLI
    * **pyaudio** for autio manipulation

### Installing

Just copy the repo and run main.py
